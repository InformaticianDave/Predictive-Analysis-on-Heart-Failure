Summary:

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of mortality worldwide, claiming an estimated 17.9 million lives annually, or 31% of all fatalities.
Heart failure is a frequent complication of CVDs, and this dataset comprises 12 variables that can be used to predict heart failure-related mortality.

Population-wide interventions can prevent the majority of cardiovascular illnesses by addressing behavioral risk factors such as cigarette use, poor food and obesity, physical inactivity, and problematic alcohol consumption.

People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, or an already established disease) require early detection and management, which can be greatly assisted by a machine learning model.

# The random forest algorithm creates numerous decision trees and blends them together, producing a more accurate and reliable prediction. The accuracy attained is statistically significant. Decision boundaries can be ascertained by splitting the data set to more manageable components.

# With the rate at which Heart Disease is becoming more prevalent among people, it is critical to recognize Heart Failure at an early stage. This study demonstrates the value of machine learning in the healthcare business for decision-making and lowering diagnostic costs. 

# The work's key contribution is the development of a novel optimum model for forecasting Heart Failure in its early stages of the disease based on the symptoms of the patient's and previous datasets, as well as the emphasis on exploratory data analysis and data processing.
